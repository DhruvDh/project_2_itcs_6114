# ITCS 6114 - Project 2

## Installation
First, ensure you have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) installed.

> For windows, you will need VC++ build tools installed, and they can be installed via Microsoft Visual Studio installer.

I will also include an executable binary in the root folder for each question, so that you don't need to install `rust` on your computer.

## Execution

Once cloned, run this command to execute the solution for question 1 -
```
cd ques_1 && cargo run
```

I have written several tests for question 1, to check whether all options are working correctly, if you trust my tests, to save time while grading, try running -

```
cd ques_1 && cargo test
```
> The tests only test the basic cases.

Run this command to execute the solution for question 2 -

```
cd ques_2 && cargo run
```
